##### Graph Neural Networks and the Graph Isomorphism Problem

In [Xu et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826), the authors prove that a graph neural network (GNN) is at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Isomorphism Test (WLT) for determining if two graphs are isomorphic or not. Afterward, this equivalence is used to derive an optimal GNN, in the sense that it can be as powerful as the WLT.

An explanation of their discoveries and alternative proofs can be found in [[doc]](https://github.com/lkania/Graph-Neural-Networks-and-the-Graph-Isomorphism-Problem/blob/master/brief.pdf). Furthermore, some possible extensions to the optimal GNN are proposed and explored empirically [[code]](https://github.com/lkania/Graph-Neural-Networks-and-the-Graph-Isomorphism-Problem/blob/master/GIN.ipynb).
